His education was undoubtedly typical of all the youth of that time and station in life. Danteâ€™s mother died only a few years after his birth, and when Dante was around 12 years old, it was arranged that he would marry Gemma Donati, the daughter of a family friend. Around 1285, the pair married, but Dante was in love with Beatrice Portinari.",
